,"World Marriage Data 2017 provides a comparable and up-to-date set of data on the marital status of the population by age and sex for 232 countries or areas of the world as of September 2017.

The database contains data on four key indicators: marital status, currently married, ever married and singulate mean age at marriage (SMAM).

For each of these indicators, data are presented from around 1950 to the most recent data available. Major sources of data on marital status presented in World Marriage Data 2017 are censuses, sample surveys and national estimates based on population register data or estimation methods using census data. Time series data on marital status indicators by age group, sex and time are available and viewable online in organized formats for users to query interactively and download (in Excel format). Interactive graphics of ever married and currently married population by age group, sex and time are viewable online and downloadable in PDF format. Information on the definition of each indicator, data sources and data limitations is provided in the metadata file.

This data set builds on the historical repository of demographic data and census and survey reports collected over the past 50 years by the Population Division and Statistics Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat. Census data are obtained from National Statistical Offices as reported to the Statistics Division or from official census publications produced by National Statistical Offices. Estimates based on data compiled from population registers are generally obtained from National Statistical Offices. Additional sources of data include survey programmes, such as the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS), Pan-Arab Project for Child Development Surveys (PAPCHILD), Pan-Arab Project for Family Health Survey (PAPFAM), Generations and Gender Programme (GGP) as well as national surveys. Tabulations for several countries are based on census microdata samples provided by National Statistical Offices to the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series, International (https://international.ipums.org/international/). The Institut National d’Etudes Démographiques (INED) and the United States Census Bureau provided tabulations from sources that were not available from the repository of demographic data and census and survey reports collected by the Population Division and Statistics Division. 

This database was prepared by Stephen Kisambira and Kyaw Kyaw Lay of the Population Division. Input on data was provided by Kirill Andreev, Vladimíra Kantorová, Ching Yee Lin, Nadia Soerjanto and Philipp Ueffing of the Population Division. Assistance on programming was provided by Ivan Prlincevic of the Population Division. This database builds upon a previous version, World Marriage Data 2015, to which the following contributed: Ann Biddlecom and Petra Nahmias (former members of the Population Division) and Camille Dorion of the Institute of Demography, University of Paris 1-Panthéon Sorbonne during her internship in the Population Division.

The Population Division is grateful for the input provided by Véronique Hertrich at INED and Loraine West and her colleagues at the United States Census Bureau.
